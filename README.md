# Margin for Godot

**Typed health classification for game systems.**

A Godot 4 addon that gives every system in your game — food, health, morale, stamina, stress, temperature, anything with a number and a threshold — typed health states, polarity handling, sigma normalization, and correction targeting.

## Install

Copy `addons/margin/` into your project's `addons/` folder. Enable in Project → Project Settings → Plugins.

## Usage

```gdscript
# Define circuits for an NPC
var npc := MarginCircuitSet.new("villager_01")
npc.add_circuit("food", 0.85, 0.70, 0.30, true, "eat")
npc.add_circuit("health", 1.0, 0.70, 0.30, true, "rest")
npc.add_circuit("stress", 0.10, 0.70, 0.30, false, "rest")  # lower is better
npc.add_circuit("morale", 0.60, 0.70, 0.30, true, "socialize")

# Update from simulation
npc.update("food", 0.35)
npc.update("stress", 0.45)

# Read health
print(npc.to_string_())
# [food:DEGRADED(-0.59σ)] [health:INTACT(0.00σ)] [stress:DEGRADED(-3.50σ)] [morale:INTACT(0.00σ)]

# What should the NPC do?
var action = npc.worst_correction()  # "eat" — food is worst
var worst = npc.worst()              # MarginCircuit for food

# Summary for UI
print(npc.summary())
# {label: villager_01, total: 4, intact: 2, degraded: 2, ablated: 0,
#  worst: food, correction: eat}
```

## The polarity problem

Every game with a stress system writes this bug:

```gdscript
# "Higher is better" works for food
if food < 0.3:
    state = "critical"

# But stress is "lower is better" — this check is backwards
if stress < 0.3:
    state = "critical"  # Wrong! Low stress is good!
```

Margin handles it:

```gdscript
# Higher is better (food, health, morale)
npc.add_circuit("food", 0.85, 0.70, 0.30, true)

# Lower is better (stress, dissonance, debt)
npc.add_circuit("stress", 0.10, 0.70, 0.30, false)
```

One flag. Classification, sigma, and correction targeting all respect it.

## Core types

### MarginHealth

Static functions for health classification:

```gdscript
MarginHealth.classify(value, intact, ablated, higher_is_better, correcting)
# Returns: MarginHealth.State.INTACT / DEGRADED / ABLATED / RECOVERING / OOD

MarginHealth.sigma(value, baseline, higher_is_better)
# Returns: float — positive = healthier, negative = worse

MarginHealth.classify_band(value, normal_low, normal_high, critical_low, critical_high)
# Returns: worse of the two boundary checks (for temperature, blood pressure, etc.)

MarginHealth.worse(state_a, state_b)
# Returns: the more severe state
```

### MarginCircuit

A named component with baseline, thresholds, health tracking, and history:

```gdscript
var c := MarginCircuit.new("food", 0.85, 0.70, 0.30, true, "eat")
c.update(0.35)

c.health              # MarginHealth.State.DEGRADED
c.sigma_value         # -0.59
c.to_atom()           # "food:DEGRADED(-0.59σ)"
c.steps_in_current_state()  # how long in this state
c.transition_count()        # how many state changes
c.time_in_state()           # {INTACT: 12, DEGRADED: 3}
```

### MarginCircuitSet

All circuits for one entity — the equivalent of a margin Expression:

```gdscript
var set := MarginCircuitSet.new("npc_01")
set.add_circuit("food", 0.85)
set.add_circuit("stress", 0.10, 0.70, 0.30, false)

set.health_of("food")       # State
set.worst()                  # MarginCircuit
set.worst_correction()       # "eat"
set.degraded()               # Array[MarginCircuit]
set.to_string_()             # bracket notation
set.summary()                # dict for UI
set.to_dict()                # for save/load
```

## Use cases

- **Colony sims** — food, shelter, morale, defense as circuits per settlement
- **Survival games** — hunger, thirst, health, temperature, sanity per character
- **Management games** — customer satisfaction, employee morale, cash flow, equipment condition
- **City builders** — water, power, traffic, happiness, crime per district
- **RPGs** — NPC need systems, faction relations, regional stability

## Format

The bracket notation is the same as the Python margin library:

```
[food:DEGRADED(-0.59σ)] [health:INTACT(0.00σ)] [stress:ABLATED(-3.50σ)]
```

Same output in GDScript and Python. Systems can interoperate.

## Part of the Margin framework

This addon is a native GDScript port of [**margin**](https://github.com/sethc5/margin) — a typed health classification framework available for Python and other languages.

The Python library includes everything in this addon plus: uncertainty algebra, policy engine (typed correction rules with backtest and tuning), contracts (typed success criteria), causal graphs (dependency explanations), forecasting, calibration from historical data, and domain adapters for healthcare, infrastructure, EV charging, aquariums, greenhouses, and fitness tracking.

```bash
pip install margin
```
